# Snake Game

## Overview
The **Snake Game** is a classic arcade game implemented in Python. This project features a graphical user interface (GUI) where players control a snake to eat food, grow in size, and score points. The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the boundaries of the game area.

## Features
- **GUI Interface**: Enjoy the snake game with an intuitive and visually appealing graphical interface.
- **Score Tracking**: Track your score as the snake consumes food and grows longer.
- **Responsive Controls**: Smooth and responsive controls to navigate the snake.
- **Game Over Detection**: The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the boundaries.

## How It Works
1. **Game Start**:
   - Run the Python program to launch the game. The snake appears on the screen and begins moving.
   
2. **Controlling the Snake**:
   - Use the arrow keys (or your specified keys) to control the direction of the snake (up, down, left, right).

3. **Eating Food**:
   - The snake must eat the food that randomly appears on the game screen. Each time the snake eats food, it grows in length, and the score increases.

4. **Game Over**:
   - The game ends if the snake collides with the boundaries of the game area or with itself. The final score is displayed.
